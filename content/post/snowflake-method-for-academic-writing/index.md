The snowflake writing method was developed by Randy Ingermanson and is originally designed for fiction writing. However, this method may also be useful for academic writing.

# Fiction vs. Academic writing
The snowflake method is based on the assumption that a story has a beginning (setup) three important events and a conclusion. In parallel the IMRAD article structure is built in a similiar way. It has:
* An introduction to the topic (why is it important? What is known?)
* Three important events
   * Presentation of a knowledge gap
   * Results and how we found them
   * Interpretation of results (discussion)
* Conclusion

Seeing as the IMRAD structure is not far from the fiction structure outlined by Randy Ingermanson we may adapt his snowflake method in the following way to academic writing.

# Ten steps to write an academic article


1. Write a one-sentence summary of the article

This sentence will be the title of your article. It should contain the main concepts investigated and how you investigated it. For example: "Development of Anxiety in adolescents: a longditudinal study".

2. Expand the sentence to a paragraph describing in more detail the main concepts, how the study was performed, what the findings were and what they mean. This paragraph will become your abstract. A template for how to write it could look like this:
* What is the study about (1 sentence)
* Why is it important (1 sentence)
* What is the knowledge gap (1 sentence)
* How was the study conducted (3 sentences)
* What did the study find (1 sentence)
* What does it mean? (1 sentence) 




3. Now consider the main concepts (fx. anxiety, brain regions, school assignments) of the article and write a one-page summary for each. This one page summary should be considered a review of the litterature for each concept and should include references to other articles.

4. Go back to the summary in step 2 and write a paragraph for each bullet point. Here you can use the information from step 3 to fill in the holes.




5. Based on your material thus far write a list of "scenes" or movements that are neccesary to move from one of your paragraphs to the next. For example it will be neccessary to know how you recruited participants in order to describe your findings. Also you will need to establish how your project addresses the knowledge gap to move from the gap to your study design.

6. Once you have a list of scenes write your first draft.

# Personal usage
This is not a method i personally use and as far as I know Randy Ingermanson does not support this method in any way. Talk it for what it's worth and use what you can and discard the rest.
