# TLDR

Gingko writing app is an app for note-taking, outlining and writing. I don't use it personally but would strongly recommend to anyone who enjoy outlining.

# What does it do

The [wavemaker](https://wavemaker.cards/) cards writing app is a comprehensive tool for writing and is heavily geared toward fictional writing. However, several of the functions may be leveraged for academic writing. The main functions in the app include:

* Minimalistic word processer to aid in focused writing
* Divide writing sections into categories and create relations to categories (Introduction is sibling to Discussion, wheras litterature review is child to Introduction)
* Snowflake methodology to develop aspects of manuscript in layers
* Kanban style planning board
* Mindmap creator
* Timeline creator
* Challenge mode (write 500 words within 5 min or everything gets deleted)
* Multiple export options and sync with google drive

# What can it be useful for

Since there are so many functions I will outline them one by one to give a brief overview of how they can be useful for academic writing. The primary function of the word processer works as wells as any other (docs/LateX/docx) so I will not go into further detail on that.

## Dividing writing sections

This function is useful for takling large projects and ensuring that the right content goes in the right places. Instead of opening your word processer and seeing the whole article you can focus on one piece at a time and gain a sense of mastery as you complete each smaller section.

## Snowflake methedology

The snowflake methedoloy is primarily used for writing fiction. However it may also be used for academic writing in the following way:

* Center of snowflake:

  * Why is this topic important to investigate (one sentence)?
  * What is known about the topic (3 sentences)?
  * What is the knowledge gap (1 sentence)?
  * What have you done to address this gap (1 sentence)?
  * What did you discover (1 sentence)?
Each of these aspects of the snowflake can then be branched out and sentences be added. In this way the outer circle of the snowflake will make up the entire article. The kanban board and mindmap

Outlining a project. Can be very useful for thesis or articles if one wants to ensure that the overall argumentation is kept the same throughout a document. 

# My personal experience

This is an app that I want to love, but actually don't. The layout is smooth the concept is clear, and it works exactly as intended. There is support for LateX, markdown tables, pictures and graphs. Really, this app does it all and more. So why don't i love it? Primarily for two reasons: theres no direct and easy way to handle citations and lack of colloboration. These issues are easy to work around, so it may be just me that is too set in my ways.

# Costs

The free version og gingko allows you 10 total documents with enough space to last for most needs. If you want more or feel like supporting the creator there is a pay what you want (recommended 12$/month) that gives you infinite space and usage. 

# Final judgmenet

If you work mostly alone, love outlining and don't mind maintaining a BibTeX citation document this app is great and I would recommend.
