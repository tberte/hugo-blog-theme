# TLDR

Wavemaker app is a great app for writing large projects with a lot of functionality. I don't use it personally but would strongly recommend to anyone who has a large complex projects and likes structuring content.

# What does it do

The [wavemaker](https://wavemaker.cards/) cards writing app is a comprehensive tool for writing and is heavily geared toward fictional writing. However, several of the functions may be leveraged for academic writing. The main functions in the app include:

* Minimalistic word processer to aid in focused writing
* Divide writing sections into categories and create relations to categories (Introduction is sibling to Discussion, wheras litterature review is child to Introduction)
* Snowflake methodology to develop aspects of manuscript in layers
* Kanban style planning board
* Mindmap creator
* Timeline creator
* Challenge mode (write 500 words within 5 min or everything gets deleted)
* Multiple export options and sync with google drive

# What can it be useful for

Since there are so many functions I will outline them one by one to give a brief overview of how they can be useful for academic writing. The primary function of the word processer works as wells as any other (docs/LateX/docx) so I will not go into further detail on that.

## Dividing writing sections

This function is useful for takling large projects and ensuring that the right content goes in the right places. Instead of opening your word processer and seeing the whole article you can focus on one piece at a time and gain a sense of mastery as you complete each smaller section.

## Snowflake methedology

The snowflake methedoloy is primarily used for writing fiction. However it may also be used for academic writing in the following way:

* Center of snowflake:

  * Why is this topic important to investigate (one sentence)?
  * What is known about the topic (3 sentences)?
  * What is the knowledge gap (1 sentence)?
  * What have you done to address this gap (1 sentence)?
  * What did you discover (1 sentence)?
    Each of these aspects of the snowflake can then be branched out and sentences be added. In this way the outer circle of the snowflake will make up the entire article. The kanban board and mindmap function in a similiar way.

Outlining a project. Can be very useful for thesis or articles if one wants to ensure that the overall argumentation is kept the same throughout a document.

## Challenge mode
This is probably one of my favorite tools and works great for those days where you get stuck in your head and can't get any words out. Make sure to set reasonable challenges so you actually have a chance to finish.

# My personal experience

Although all the functions in the wavemaker app seem great I have personally found little use of them. The one function that I have used occasionally is the challenge mode, which is great when you get stuck in your writing. I would definetly recommend wavemaker if you have a large project or are writing a book by yourself.

# Costs

One of the best things about wavemaker is that it is completely free.

# Final judgmenet

If you have a complex and large project or need help sorting your thoughts then wavemaker could be perfect for you. If you find that using apps and gimicks are already taking more time from your writing than they are adding than I would suggest passing on this fine software.
