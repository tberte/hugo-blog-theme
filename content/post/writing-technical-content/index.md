TLDR;

# What does it do

The gingko writting app is based around the ideas of having layers of thoughts. What you are presented with when you enter is three colomns (additional colomns can be added as needed) that can be scrolled up/down independently. The intent is that you can have your most simple outline in the left-most colomn, your more detailed outline can be in the middle and your actual writing can be in the right-most colomn. The app is non-restrictive so you could also have notes on one concept in the left-most colomn, notes on another concept in the middle and your writing in the right-most colomn.

# What can it be useful for

Outlining a project. Can be very useful for thesis or articles if one wants to ensure that the overall argumentation is kept the same throughout a document. 

# My personal experience

This is an app that I want to love, but actually don't. The layout is smooth the concept is clear, and it works exactly as intended. There is support for LateX, markdown tables, pictures and graphs. Really, this app does it all and more. So why don't i love it? Primarily for two reasons: theres no direct and easy way to handle citations and lack of colloboration. These issues are easy to work around, so it may be just me that is too set in my ways.

# Costs
The free version og gingko allows you 10 total documents with enough space to last for most needs. If you want more or feel like supporting the creator there is a pay what you want (recommended 12$/month) that gives you infinite space and usage. 

# Final judgmenet
If you work mostly alone, love outlining and don't mind maintaining a BibTeX citation document this app is great and I would recommend.
